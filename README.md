# RFM---Customer-Segmentation-and-Churn-Analysis
Consumer360 is an end-to-end retail analytics project designed to analyze customer behavior, identify high-value segments, and detect churn risk using RFM analysis. The project integrates SQL, Python, and Power BI with automation to deliver actionable business insights.

🚀 Project Objectives

Build a Customer 360° view

Identify high-value and at-risk customers

Perform RFM-based customer segmentation

Analyze sales trends, regions, products, and categories

Automate the data pipeline for scheduled refresh

🛠️ Tech Stack Used

SQL – Data extraction, joins, transformations

Python (Pandas, NumPy) – RFM analysis, CLV calculation, automation

Power BI – Interactive dashboards & insights

Windows Task Scheduler – ETL automation

CSV / Flat files – Data source simulation

🔁 Data Pipeline Flow Raw Retail Data ↓ SQL Cleaning & Aggregation ↓ Python RFM & Churn Analysis ↓ Automated CSV Output ↓ Power BI Dashboards

📈 Key Dashboards 1️⃣ Retail Analytics Dashboard

Total Orders, Customers, Sales, Quantity

Sales by Country, Region, Category, Product

Monthly Sales Trend

Region & Year slicers for dynamic filtering

2️⃣ RFM & Churn Dashboard

Customer Segmentation (Champions, Loyal, At Risk, Others)

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Churn Risk vs Active Customers

Segment-wise Frequency, Monetary & Recency analysis

🧠 Key Business Insights

Champions contribute the highest CLV with frequent purchases

At Risk customers show high recency → churn prevention needed

West & South regions generate maximum sales

Electronics & Clothing dominate revenue

A small % of customers generate a large % of revenue (Pareto effect)

⚙️ Automation

Python ETL script scheduled using Windows Task Scheduler

Automatically refreshes RFM output

Power BI refresh reflects updated insights without manual effort
